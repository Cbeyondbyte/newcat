        <b>A cat is a domestic animal but there are wild cats too.
            Cats are found in various colours. The eyes of the cat which
            are of gray colour shine at night. A cat has sharp claws.
            The food of the cat is rats, pigeons and birds.
            She is fond of milk. It can climb up a tree and <!--info for cat -->
            can jump from one roof to the other. When she mews
            the rats run away, and she also kills them.
            In this way she keeps rats away from our house.
            She has soft fur. She gives birth to kittens
            once in a year. She is very afraid of dogs</b>
